# Polaris icons

Polaris icons is the collective name for our new, cohesive, icon system. As part of the wider drive toward cross-platform unity, this system aims to provide internal teams with the iconographic resources they need to work within the new Polaris design system.

Icons within this system are simple and friendly. Each icon is an exercise in distillation, in taking a metaphor and representing its most basic form.

## Sketch file

The sketch file contains everything within the Polaris icons system. The `Polaris icons` page contains an alphabetically sorted list of icons within the system, split into `major` and `minor` sections for ease of browsing.

The sketch file can be found in Abstract [here](https://share.abstractapp.com/f348c474-832c-4032-8867-4c84286d8666).

_When using icons, please be sympathetic toward our goal of cohesion and don’t use an icon for a purpose it was not intended for. If you need an icon, please see *Section 3* below._

## Major and Minor icons

Within the system there are 2 distinct icon variants, `major` and `minor` icons. While they are part of the same larger system, they differ in design and implementation and have specific use cases.

### Implementation

In **both** cases, icons are exported on a `20px` by `20px` SVG canvas. The reason for this is to make using them in production code as simple as possible. All that’s needed is to identify the type of icon (i.e. `major` or `minor`) without worrying about setting explicit sizing.

### Use cases

See our [icon usage guidelines](https://polaris.shopify.com/design/icons).

## Spot icons

WIP, more information coming soon.

Our spot icon system was redesigned in August 2018, and as of now (early September 2018), is currently in the process of being rolled out. Moving forward, any new spot icons will be developed in this new style.
