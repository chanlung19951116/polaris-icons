# Polaris icons: design contributor’s guide

Polaris icons is a collection of simple and informative icons that draw on the visual language of the Polaris design system. Use these icons in your projects or third-party apps to promote a consistent experience across the Shopify platform.

Icons within this system aim to be simple and friendly. Each icon is an exercise in distillation, in taking a metaphor and representing its most basic form.

## Figma file and library

The [System icons Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/yRlsqZAKb6YrFfAy9W9ogb/System-Icons) contains all Polaris icons, split into `major` and `minor` pages.

To access Polaris icons via Figma’s _Assets_ panel (<kbd>option</kbd> + <kbd>2</kbd>), enable the _System Icons_ library.

_When using icons, please be sympathetic toward our goal of cohesion and don’t use an icon for a purpose it was not intended for. If you need an icon, please refer to *Section 3* below._

## Major and Minor icons

The system has 2 icon variants: `major` and `minor`. While they are part of the same larger system, they differ in design and implementation and have specific use cases.

### Implementation

In **both** cases, icons are exported on a `20px` by `20px` SVG canvas. The reason for this is to make using them in production code as simple as possible. All that’s needed is to identify the type of icon (`major` or `minor`) without worrying about setting explicit sizing.

### Use cases

Refer to the [Polaris icon usage guidelines](https://polaris.shopify.com/design/icons).

## Spot icons

Work in progress, more information coming soon.

Our spot icon system was redesigned in August 2018, and as of now (early September 2018), is currently in the process of being rolled out. Moving forward, any new spot icons will be developed in this new style.
