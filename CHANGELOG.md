# Changelog

Polaris icons are versioned as a [monorepo][monorepo] using [lerna][lerna]. Several other large open-source projects are distributed this way, including [Babel][babel] and [React][react].

This means that `CHANGELOG.md` files are distributed alongside packages themselves in the [`packages`](./packages) directory.

For example, the package `@shopify/polaris-icons` has a `CHANGELOG.md` in [`packages/polaris-icons/CHANGELOG.md`](./packages/polaris-icons/CHANGELOG.md).
