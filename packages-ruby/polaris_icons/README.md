# polaris_icons

> This package exports icons in SVG and PDF formats, for Shopify internal use only.

## Getting started

This package is published to Shopify's private rubygems registry, and can't be used for open source projects.

Although it's possible to use this package directly, we recommend using the icons in this package through [Polaris-Rails](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-rails) (private repository) in combination with the `ui_icon` helper from that project. Make sure that your app is using Polaris Rails version 18.7.0 or higher.

## Usage

See the [polaris-rails documentation](https://polaris-rails.shopify.com/components/icon) for usage instructions.

### SVG and PDF files

For consumers who don‚Äôt use polaris-rails, we provide SVG files within the `images/svg` folder and PDF files within the `images/pdf` folder.

## Contributing üôå
